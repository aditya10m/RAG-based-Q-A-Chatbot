# RAG-based-Q-A-Chatbot
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot that provides accurate, context-aware answers by combining FAISS vector search with Transformer-based language models. The system retrieves relevant document chunks from a local knowledge base and feeds them into an LLM to reduce hallucinations and improve factual responses.
